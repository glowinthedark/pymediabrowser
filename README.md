# PyMediaCenter
A local media browser app for navigating file systems that contain images, audio or video files, and displaying associated content such as PDF, HTML, or TXT. 

The primary use case is viewing audio or video files with associated notes in PDF, HTML or TXT format. VTT and SRT video subtitles are supported. Clicking a media file will open it in the preview panel and search for a matching PDF or HTML file with the same base name. If a matching content file was found it will be loaded in the preview panel below the media panel. You can define custom matching logic by adding the regular expression pair in `config.js`.

For image files thumbnail previews are generated in the left navigation panel which makes it possible to use the app as a gallery viewer.

The app is based on Python's SimpleHTTPServer web server with a browser-based HTML+JS content.

#### Features:

* browsing audio, video, text, and images with thumbnail previews
* displaying PDF and HTML content with associated audio/video links
* resizable navigation and content panels
* custom media root folder (by default `/` or `c:\` on windows).
* start/stop media playback on mouse click or on spacebar press.

Example: if a folder contains a PDF file named `lesson-01.pdf` and a video file named `lesson-01.mp4`, then clicking the PDF file will display it in the content panel while the video will start playing in the media panel above.

## Supported media formats
Playback of media files is handled by the web browser therefore support is limited to the capabilities of the corresponding HTML5 `<audio/>` and `<video/>` elements which currently include: MP3, MP4 audio/video (H.264, AAC, MP3 codecs), MP4 container with Flac codec, OGG audio and video (Theora, Vorbis, Opus, Flac codecs), FLAC, WebM audio/video (VP8, VP9 codecs), WAV (PCM).

For more details refer to [mozilla browser media compatibility table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats#Browser_compatibility).
