# PyMediaCenter
A local media browser app for navigating file systems that contain images, audio or video files, and displaying associated content such as PDF, HTML, or TXT. 

The primary use case is viewing audio or video files with associated notes in PDF, HTML or TXT format. Clicking a media file will open it in the preview panel and search for a matching PDF or HTML file with the same base name. If a matching content file was found it will be loaded in the preview panel below the media panel. You can define custom matching logic by adding the regular expression pair in `config.js`.

For image files thumbnail previews are generated in the left navigation panel which makes it possible to use the app as a gallery viewer.

The app is implemented as a tiny web server that opens a page in your browser with content split into a left navigation  panel, a media panel for video or audio, and a content panel for PDF and HTML.

For displaying PDF files the browser must have the corresponding plugins â€” Chrome and Firefox support PDFs out of the box. For displaying PDF files in Internet Explorer, Adobe Reader or [Foxit Reader plugin](https://help.foxitsoftware.com/kb/how-to-configure-internet-explorer-to-use-foxit-pdf-plugin.php) must be installed.

#### Features:

* M3U playlist generation for folders with media files
* browsing images with thumbnail previews in the left navigation panel (gallery mode)
* displaying PDF and HTML content with associated audio/video links
* user-defined regular expressions for matching media files to PDF, HTML or text content (`config.js`)
* adjustable playback speed for media files
* resizable navigation and content panels
* auto-open browser window on server start
* custom media root folder can be specified as first argument (by default the system root will be used (e.g. `/` or `c:\` on windows).
* start/stop media playback on mouse click or on spacebar press.

Example: if a folder contains a PDF file named `lesson-01.pdf` and a video file named `lesson-01.mp4`, then clicking the PDF file will display it in the content panel while the video will start playing in the media panel above.
